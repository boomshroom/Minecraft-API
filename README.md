# Workbench
Workbench is the working name of the official Minecraft API, currently in very early stages of development. Its goal is to provide a means of allowing anyone to pick up Minecraft and easily achieve any goal from modifying gameplay to creating utilities to overhauling the client's graphics.

## Compilation
We're currently using Maven to compile the API, and here's how you can too!

* Install [Maven 3](http://maven.apache.org/download.html)
* Check out this repo and: `mvn clean install`

## Running
By itself the API will do nothing. It must be implemented by a third party to work. Minecraft itself will be the official implementation of this API. At time of writing, there is one implementation, ;) [my spout bridge] (https://github.com/boomshroom/Bridge/tree/workbench/src/main/java/org/spout/bridge/workbench).

## Discussion
The official IRC channels for the API are located on [irc.esper.net at #minecraftdev and #minecraftdev-discuss](http://webchat.esper.net/?nick=&channels=minecraftdev%2Cminecraftdev-discuss). You may also follow us on twitter for commit updates at [@MinecraftAPIBot](http://twitter.com/MinecraftAPIBot).

## Coding Standards
* Javadocs are vital and must be used for every public facing method. They must note any possible raised exception, the return result (if any), the method arguments (if any) and a description of the method - this is a minimum, more is better.
* All public facing methods must be input validated and raise exceptions if something is wrong. It's better to catch a bug that may happen than let it grow into something worse.
* No tabs, use 4 space indents. No trailing whitespaces. Use sun/oracle coding standards if in doubt.
* Where possible, use tests. Lots of them.
* Absolutely no already-implemented classes. Use interfaces, and have util classes created by a implementation-controlled Factory.
* Give users the ability to do something directly rather than indirectly. It's better to have a concrete way of doing X than to have a roundabout way of doing X for now which may not work later.
